## Tools

This project uses the phone connection provided by [Firebase](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_auth).
It also uses [MobX](https://pub.dev/packages/mobx) and [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) to manage the state of the application simply and efficiently. 

## Configuration

This project works with Firebase so you need to import your own Google Services files on Android & iOS folder after creating your Firebase project. Remember to enable phone authentication in your Firebase project.
